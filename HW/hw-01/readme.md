# HW 1

HW 1 is described in `HW1.ipynb`. A blank code or markup cell will be left after each exercise for you to fill in with your solution.

# Due Date

This problem set is due on Monday at 11:59 pm. Remember that the TA will only grade the last commit pushed to your personal HW repository before this time. If you think you might not finish in time, it may be worth it to push a partially complete submission well before the deadline. You can always push new changes that you might make and they will be graded as long as they are pushed and time-stamped before 11:59 pm.
