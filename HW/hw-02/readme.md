# HW 02

This homework is due on Monday, 4/16 at **7:00 PM**. The TA will go over the HW during the TA session, so homework must be turned in before then. (The TA session is at 7:30 PM, but I want there to be some buffer time in between the start of the TA session and time the HW is due.)

 - Pandas Exercises: Solve the exercises in the Jupyter notebook called `euro2012.ipynb`.
 - Exploring Economic data: Solve the exercises in the Jupyter notebook called `quandl-first-steps.ipynb`.
 - Economics Application: Solve the exercises in the Jupyter notebook called `schelling_segregation_model.ipynb`.
