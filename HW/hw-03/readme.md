# HW 03

This homework is due on Monday, 4/23 at **7:00 PM**. The TA will go over the HW during the TA session, so homework must be turned in before then. (The TA session is at 7:30 PM, but I want there to be some buffer time in between the start of the TA session and time the HW is due.)

 - Part 1: Solve the exercises in the Jupyter notebook called `creating_reading_writing.ipynb`.
 - Part 2: Solve the exercises in the Jupyter notebook called `renaming_and_combining.ipynb`.
 - Part 3: Solve the exercises in the Jupyter notebook called `chipotle.ipynb`.
