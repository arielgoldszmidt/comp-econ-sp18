An application of MLE to Structural Industrial Organization
===========================================================

 - In this lecture we will discuss the classic Industrial Organization (IO) paper ["Entry and competition in concentrated markets,"](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/261786) by Bresnahan and Reiss (1991). 
 - I've included a discussion of this paper in `bresnahan-reiss-1991-discussion.ipynb`. The HW will have you replicate aspects of this paper. This will be an application of maximum likelihood estimation.
 - You should be able to download the original paper [here](http://people.hss.caltech.edu/~mshum/gradio/papers/bresreiss_jpe.pdf).
